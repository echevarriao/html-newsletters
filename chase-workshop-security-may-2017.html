<p>You are invited to attend the 2017 CHASE/CHESS industry workshop on May 17 and 18 at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, CT.</p>

<p>CHASE (Center for Hardware Assurance, Security and Engineering) has established itself as the premier research institute addressing integrated circuit security, counterfeits, and supply chain assurance. With new challenges arising in the protection of critical infrastructure and the systems that underlie them, we have created a new center at UConn called the Center for Hardware and Embedded Systems Security (CHESS) in cooperation with Northeastern University and the University of Virginia. The mission of the CHESS center is to address the research challenges that industry faces in the design, protection, and resilience of cyber-physical systems from the security vulnerabilities associated with embedded hardware and embedded systems.</p>
    
<p>As CHASE and CHESS prepare its future roadmap, we want to make sure that we are addressing the research needs of industry. In that light, we are hoping that the workshop will be an opportunity for you and others from industry to provide us your input.</p>

<p>The first day of the workshop on May 17 is dedicated to CHASE topics on counterfeit detection and prevention, IC reverse engineering, microelectronics anti-tampering, physical unclonable functions, hardware Trojans, and hardware security. The second day will be dedicated to the new CHESS center and topics such as secure systems design methodology, formal verification for security, embedded systems vulnerability, secure communications protocols, secure processor architectures, SCADA/control systems security, and resilient systems design.</p>
