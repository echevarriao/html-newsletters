<p><strong><em>SHAP3D</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Please join the University of Connecticut for a webinar discussion on&nbsp;<strong>Monday May 22<sup>nd</sup></strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong>10:00-11:30am</strong>&nbsp;to learn about “Science of Heterogeneous Additive Printing of 3D Materials (SHAP3D).”&nbsp; This is an Industry/University Cooperative&nbsp;Research Center (I/UCRC) opportunity funded by the National Science Foundation to&nbsp;catalyze the technological development of additive&nbsp;manufacturing, also known as 3D printing.&nbsp; The partners are University of Massachusetts at Lowell (UML), University of Connecticut (UC), and Georgia Institute of Technology (GT).&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The three universities propose to&nbsp;combine and leverage&nbsp;their expertise in material and manufacturing by forming the&nbsp;SHAP3D&nbsp;Center (see attached summary). The work would encompass many different additive&nbsp;manufacturing&nbsp;methods and will enable: 1) the rational design and creation of new material feedstocks, 2) understanding the material properties, protocols, and design rules used in 3D printing, 3) developing new 3D printing methods for novel materials and composites.</em></p>
<p><em>An I/UCRC is a platform where university faculty and student work together with industrial members. A center typically consists of several universities and each university is called a site. In a center, faculty and students conduct research on pre-competitive projects that are defined by industry advisor board (IAB) using the pooled membership fee and NSF funding. The industry members have the priority to access the research portfolio and thus to expedite the commercialization of the research outcome.</em></p>
<p><em>The mission of the SHAP3D Center is to perform&nbsp;<u>pre-competitive</u>&nbsp;research to provide the fundamental knowledge for 3D printed heterogeneous materials and products that integrate multiple engineering materials with complex 3D structures and diverse functionality. Through fundamental material modeling and processing research, SHAP3D will develop the critical and necessary insight into the structure-processing-property relationships to predict and control the integration of diverse materials by different 3D printing methods.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Please register at the website link given below. Registration will close Friday May 19th&nbsp;at 12:00pm. For any questions, please e-mail: <a href="mailto:anson.ma@uconn.edu">anson.ma@uconn.edu</a>.</em></strong></p>
