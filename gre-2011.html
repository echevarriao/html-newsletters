<p>Hello, X!</p>
<p>As a top student who recently took the GRE, you are contemplating graduate studies and reviewing your options. We ask you to explore the School of Engineering at the University of Connecticut. We offer exceptional opportunities for students interested in pursuing a graduate degree in engineering, and we invite you to explore our website and the links below to learn more.</p>
<p>UConn Engineering is recognized for its outstanding combination of innovative research and faculty excellence, competitive graduate support, a vibrant campus and community, and proximity to major urban centers.</p>
<ul>
<li>We offer nine Ph.D. 	and M.S. degree programs in core and interdisciplinary subjects. <a href="http://www.engr.uconn.edu/facultyhighlights.php">Our 	faculty</a> members are superbly trained, widely respected, and involved in 	exciting strategic research in areas such as nanotechnology, 	sustainable engineering, security technologies, wireless and sensor 	network technologies, informatics and bioinformatics, tissue 	engineering and regenerative medicine, to name a few.</li>

<li>Nestled amid 	handsome forests and farmlands, UConn also offers close proximity to 	the urban centers of Hartford, Boston and New York City. The UConn 	community also provides exciting cultural and athletic activities, <a href="http://www.reslife.uconn.edu/graduate_housing.html">dedicated 	housing</a> for graduate student families as well as individual students, and <a href="http://www.csde.state.ct.us/public/der/ssp/dist0708/dist049.pdf">excellent 	K-12 schools</a> that are ranked among the top in the State. Take a virtual tour of <a href="http://admissions.uconn.edu/virtualtour/">campus 	here</a>.</li>
<li>Ph.D. students 	receive competitive <a href="http://www.payroll.uconn.edu/resources/dept_admin/ga_stipend_listing_2009_2010.html">stipends</a> and excellent <a href="http://www.shs.uconn.edu/insurance.html">health 	insurance</a>. 	Many students also receive prestigious <a href="http://www.engr.uconn.edu/gradfellowships.php">graduate 	fellowships</a>. 	In the past two years, we have captured five <a href="http://www.engr.uconn.edu/gaann/">Graduate 	Assistance in Areas of National Need</a> (GAANN) awards in the areas of biomaterials, sustainable energy, 	advanced computing, security and cloud computing. In 2010, we 	garnered an <a href="http://www.engr.uconn.edu/gk12/">NSF 	GK-12</a> award (total $2.7M), which partners graduate students in engineering 	with technical high school teachers and students. Through these 	programs, more than 45 fellows are supported per year.</li>

<li>To enrich the 	current graduate programs and enhance studentsâ€™ career trajectory 	planning, we recently launched a new program for <a href="http://grad.engr.uconn.edu/">Graduate 	Professional Development</a>. 	Our graduates advance to impressive careers in industry, government 	and academic institutions. Over 150 of our Ph.D. alumni serve as 	faculty members at top colleges and universities across the globe.</li>
</ul>
