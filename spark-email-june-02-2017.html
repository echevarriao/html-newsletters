        <td><p>Dear Educator,</p>
<p>A few weeks ago we wrote to introduce you to SPARK, a new STEM summer camp for middle and high school girls at UConn Storrs.</p>
<p>We are excited to share that we have <u>extended the application deadline to June 30th</u>. In addition, we now have scholarships available to cover the full $895 program fee for up to ten girls per week.</p>
<p>SPARK offers 3 week-long camps in different disciplines: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Coding with Arduino (July 9-15)</li>
	<li>Robotics with underwater robotics (July 16-22)</li>
	<li>3D printing (July 23-29)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>SPARK Program Flyer</b> -- <a href="http://edoc.engr.uconn.edu/spark/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/06/SPARK-2017-flyer.pdf">Download</a></p>
<p><strong>Scholarships</strong>: One teacher or guidance counselor from each school may recommend one student for a scholarship for each week of the program. To be considered, the student must submit an application online at <a href="http://edoc.engr.uconn.edu/spark/">http://edoc.engr.uconn.edu/spark/</a> and the teacher/counselor must separately submit a letter of recommendation which includes the studentâ€™s financial need to <a href="mailto:engr-edpsw@uconn.edu">engr-edpsw@uconn.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Attached is an updated program flyer for you to share with students and teachers.</p>
<p>With best wishes for the summer,</p>
<p><em>Kevin McLaughlin</em></p>
