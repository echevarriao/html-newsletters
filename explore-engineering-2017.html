<p>Dear Educator,</p>
<img align = "right" src="http://edoc.engr.uconn.edu/explore-engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/05/explore-engineering-300x258.png" alt = "image: explore engineering" /><p>This summer, the <a href="http://www.uconn.edu/">University of Connecticut</a> is excited to again offering <a href="http://edoc.engr.uconn.edu/explore-engineering/">Explore Engineering</a> (E2), a week-long residential program for current 10th and 11th grade students interested in engineering.</p>
<p>This fun program allows students to explore various engineering disciplines on the University of Connecticut main campus in Storrs. Since engineering is not a taught discipline in high school, this program exposes many students to the field for the first time. It often has a profound effect on students' future field of study and career.</p>
<p>There will be two sessions this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sunday, June 18th to Thursday, June 22nd, 2017</li>
<li>Sunday, June 25th to Thursday, June 29th, 2017</li>
</ul>
<p>The application deadline has been extended June 1, 2017.</p>
<p>Attached is a program flyer to provide you and your students more information.</p>
<p>Additional information, including testimonials and application instructions are available at: <a href="http://edoc.engr.uconn.edu/explore-engineering/">http://edoc.engr.uconn.edu/explore-engineering/</a>.</p>
