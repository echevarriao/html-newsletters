<p align="center">CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p align="center">7th IEEE International Conference on Computational</p>
<p align="center">Advances in Bio and Medical Sciences (ICCABS)</p>
<p align="center">October 19-21, Orlando, FL, USA</p>
<p align="justify">Advances in high-throughput technologies such as DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry are profoundly transforming life sciences, resulting in the collection of unprecedented amounts of biological and medical data. Using this data to advance our knowledge about fundamental biological processes and improve human health requires novel computational models and advanced analysis algorithms. IEEE ICCABS aims to bring together leading academic and industry researchers to discuss the latest advances in computational methods for bio and medical sciences.</p>
<p>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biological Big Data Analytics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Biological modeling and simulation</strong> (Molecular and cellular modeling, stochastic and rule-based modeling, modeling languages and systems);</li>
<li><strong>Biomedical image processing</strong> (Image segmentation and classification, visualization, functional and molecular imaging);</li>
<li><strong>Biomedical data and literature mining</strong> (Data integration, knowledge discovery from electronic medical records and scientific literature);</li>
</ul>
